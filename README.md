### Google Merchandise Site Dashboard built with Google Analytics Data as exercise during Data Science Academy's Power BI course.

These are the dataset and Dashboards I`ve built during the ninth chapter of [Data Science Academy's Power BI Course](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/course?courseid=microsoft-power-bi-para-data-science) as a case study. For more information on it check my Medium post [Answering Questions with Mobile Dashboards on Health Insurance](https://medium.com/@douglas.rochedo/google-analytics-data-dashboard-on-google-merchandise-store-3c0caafeb341).

All content in English is made by me and I shall not translate everything to English. So, if you want to understand better what I have done here, it is best you check the Medium post than try to understand from the content available here.
